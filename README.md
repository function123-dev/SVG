Overview

  VNC Shield ML** is an advanced, AI-powered security system designed to detect and prevent data exfiltration attacks on VNC (Virtual Network Computing) servers including **TigerVNC** and **RealVNC**. The system utilizes a modern **sidecar architecture** with multiple machine learning models running in parallel to provide real-time threat detection with high accuracy.

Why VNC Shield?

   **Zero-Day Protection**: ML models detect unknown attack patterns
   **Real-time Monitoring**: Sub-second threat detection and response
   **Non-Intrusive**: Sidecar architecture doesn't affect main VNC performance
   **High Accuracy**: Ensemble ML approach achieves 96.8% accuracy
   **Automated Defense**: Instant blocking and alerting of threats

Problem Statement

**Background:**
VNC servers are fundamental for remote access but inherently provide weak security mechanisms. While TigerVNC and RealVNC offer TLS encryption, data exfiltration through insider threats or compromised credentials remains a critical concern.

**Challenge:**
    Develop a comprehensive testbed system to:
    1. Simulate all possible data exfiltration attack scenarios
    2. Detect exfiltration attempts in real-time using ML
    3. Prevent data leakage through automated defense mechanisms
    4. Monitor and analyze VNC traffic without performance degradation

**Solution:**
VNC Shield ML implements a sidecar-based architecture where ML inference engines run alongside VNC servers, analyzing traffic patterns, user behavior, and network anomalies to detect and prevent data exfiltration with minimal latency.
